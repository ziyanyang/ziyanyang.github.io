I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vicente Ordóñez Román](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/). 
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Bryn Mawr College](http://www.brynmawr.edu).
My research focuses on multimodal machine learning, especially vision and language. 

During my Ph.D, I have interned at [eBay](https://tech.ebayinc.com/research/) in summer 2022 mentored by [Jiangbo Yuan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiangbo-yuan/) on building pipelines for object detection models. I also have interned at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) in summer 2023 under the guidance of [Kushal Kafle](https://kushalkafle.com/),[Zhihong Ding](https://research.adobe.com/person/zhihong-ding/), [Zhe Lin](https://research.adobe.com/person/zhe-lin/) and [Scott Cohen](https://research.adobe.com/person/scott-cohen/), focusing on relation-object prediction and grounding. Here is my [CV][ziyan_cv.pdf]
